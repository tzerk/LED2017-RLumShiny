## Problem description

  "While <b>R</b> is a comparatively easy-to-learn programming
language, there is still a steep learning curve until a user
is able to routinely achieve the desired results. In-depth
knowledge of <b>R</b> fundamentals is not required when
working with the 'Luminescence' package, but being
familiar with the most important data structures in R is
a must.", tags$br(), tags$br(),
  "In the simplest case, for a specific task, using
the package only involves a single short function call,
e.g., ", tags$code("Luminescence::plot_AbanicoPlot(data = de.data)"), " to produce
an abanico plot (Dietze et al., 2016)
of equivalent dose estimates. However, users may want to
adjust the plot according to their requirements. While other
software products such as Origin&reg; or SigmaPlot&reg; allow the
user to comfortably click on each element of a plot to change
its appearance, this is not possible in <b>R</b>. In <b>R</b> a plot cannot
be changed after it has been drawn, and the user is required
to re-run the function call with additional arguments that
control the appearance of specific plot elements. For the",
  tags$code("Luminescence::plot_AbanicoPlot()"), "function
there are currently 33 such arguments, plus additional base
<b>R</b> arguments that can be used to design the plot to ones
desire. For more elaborate plots the function call in the <b>R</b>
command-line rapidly increases in complexity.", tags$br(), tags$br(),
  "Users new to <b>R</b> may feel quickly overwhelmed and may hence not be able
to exploit the full potential of the <b>R</b> command-line. But even
experienced users may find it tedious to iteratively run the
function until a satisfying results is produced."

In Human-Computer Interaction an alternative approach to the
command-line interface (<b>CLI</b>) is the graphical user interface
(<b>GUI</b>), which allows direct, interactive manipulation and
interaction with the underlying software. For users with

intuitive access that counteracts the perceived steep learning
curve of a CLI (Unwin & Hofmann, 1999).", tags$br(), tags$br(),
  "Here, we present a GUI for the R package <code>Luminescence</code>
in the form of interactive web applications. These applications
can be accessed online so that a user is not even
required to have a local installation of <b>R</b>. The so-called shiny
applications provide access to most of the plotting functions
of the R package <code>Luminescence</code> as well as to the functions
for calculating the cosmic dose rate and for transforming
CW-OSL curves. We further introduce the <b>R</b>
package <code>RLumShiny</code> (Burow, 2016) that bundles all
applications, is freely available through the CRAN and

  A shiny application consists of the two files named <code>Ui.R</code> and <code>Server.R</code>.
  The <code>Ui.R</code> file is used for the user-interface definition, i.e. where 
  you design the look and feel of your graphical user interface and define all the input elements the
  user can interact with. The code in <code>Ui.R</code> is used to generate and render a HTML page like the one
  you are looking at right at this moment. Without going too deep into the details about the various options when
  designing the page layout itself, the most straight-forward layout is produced by the function
  <code>fluidPage()</code> and the nested functions <code>titlePanel()</code>, 
  <code>sidebarLayout()</code> and <code>mainPanel()</code>. Using this layout the input elements 
  (so-called 'widgets') are placed in the sidebar, and output elements are defined in the main panel.
  In the example shown here the application consists of only one input element (<code>sliderInput()</code>)
  and a panel to show a plot (<code>plotOutput()</code>).", tags$br(), tags$br(),
  "The <code>Server.R</code> defines the actual server logic. Think of this file more of a normal
  <b>R</b> script file you would write to e.g. produce a plot, but instead of using static 
  variables you have access to the output of the input widgets defined in the <code>Ui.R</code>.
  Naturally, as the user interacts with the input widget its return value changes, and depending
  the calculations defined in the <code>Server.R</code> the output also changes. In our example
  the user interacts with a simple slider that returns a <code>numeric</code> value, which
  in turn is used in the <code>Server.R</code> (<code>input$bins</code>) to plot a histogram
  with the specified number of bins.", tags$br(), tags$br(),
  "The real 'magic' of shiny is that any changes to the input widgets are automatically recognized,

  the output (e.g. the plot)."

sharing the applications with a wider user base, whether it
be an organisation, a working group or anyone interested in
using it by making it freely accessible on the internet. Some
of the advantages include that, amongst all potential users of
the service, only one person is required to set up and maintain
the Shiny Server. It has to be considered, however, that
setting up a Shiny Server requires a server (or web space),
which may need to be purchased or rented first, and a person
with sufficient knowledge in administrating a Linux server.
Furthermore, the open source version of Shiny Server only
has a limited amount of features compared to the Pro version
that is subject to fee. Nonetheless, the advantages of running
a freely accessible, local or access limited Shiny Server can
far outweigh these drawbacks and once set up, can provide
unlimited and platform independent access to the shiny applications.",

on the desired number of allowed applications, service
