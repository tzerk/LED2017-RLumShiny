Since the release of the **R** package 'Luminescence’ in 2012 the functionality 
of the package has been greatly enhanced by implementing further functions for 
measurement data processing, statistical analysis and graphical output. 
Along with the accompanying increase in complexity of the package, working with 
the command-line interface of **R** can be tedious, especially for users without 
previous experience in programming languages. Here, we present a collection of 
interactive web applications that provide a user-friendly graphical user 
interface for the ’Luminescence’ package. These applications can be accessed 
over the internet or used on a local computer using the **R** package ’RLumShiny’.
